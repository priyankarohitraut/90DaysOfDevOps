Capture a quick health snapshot (CPU, memory, disk, network)
1 cpu: usetop or htop for a dynamic view or mpstst for a summary.
2 memory: use free -h to see memory usage in a human readable format.
3 disk: use df -h to check disk space usage and iostat for disk l/0 stats.
4 network: use ifconfig or ip addr to see network interface,and ping or netstat to check 
connectivity or active connection.


Trace logs for that service
1 use journalctl -u <service-name> to see logs for that specific service. add flags like -f to follow 
logs in real time or --since to specify a time range.
2 if the service uses traditional log files , check /var/log/ or its subdirectories for relevant files .
for eg- tail -f /var/log/<service>.log will the log file in real time.


Write a mini runbook describing what you did and what you’d do next if things were worse

Checked CPU: We used top to assess current CPU load and identify any processes consuming excessive resources.

Checked Memory: We ran free -h to confirm memory usage and check for any signs of low available memory or swap usage.

Checked Disk: We used df -h to inspect disk space and ensure no partitions were full.

Checked Network: We verified network status with ip addr and ping to check connectivity.

What To Do Next If Things Get Worse

CPU Spikes: Identify specific processes using high CPU (top) and consider restarting or optimizing them. If systemic, investigate application efficiency or scaling.

Memory Pressure: Identify memory-hungry processes (top or ps) and restart or reallocate resources. Consider adding swap or increasing physical memory if persistent.

Disk Full or Slow: Identify large or unnecessary files and clear space. If I/O is an issue, check disk health (iostat) or consider moving to faster storage (SSD).

Network Issues: If connectivity fails, trace with ping, traceroute, or nslookup. Check physical connections, DNS configuration, or firewall settings.
